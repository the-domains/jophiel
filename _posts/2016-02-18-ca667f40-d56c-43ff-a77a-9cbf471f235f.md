## Recommendation from Douglas McShane, Owner / Acorn Technologies

"Without question, one of the sharpest individuals I have had the pleasure of working with. Excellent all-around grasp of the "big 3" for Web: art acumen (the actual design), software use/programming knowledge (the mechanical), and truly understanding the business and message (the communication). Rare combination of talent/skill-sets. I am glad to endorse."
